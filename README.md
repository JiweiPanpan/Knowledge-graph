# Graph Neural Networks For Text Embeddings

The file name "Knowlege graph" is about the model of "GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS FOR TEXT EMBEDDING". Our aim is to predict tail entities in knowledge graph triples. We use the TransE model and give an improved method for wordembedding. Finally, Hit@10 and MRR were used to evaluate the accuracy.

## Dependencies

- numpy 1.24.3
- cuda 11.8
- pytorch 2.0.1

## Run the code

- run main.py by 'python3 main.py'

## Usage

- model.py    knowledge graph embedding model, transe model
- dataset.py  read the dataset from the knowledge graph dataset
- metrics.py  test procedure
- config.py   configurations including device, margin
- main.py
